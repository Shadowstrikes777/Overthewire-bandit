The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH.

First find out what SSH is, then using the password and the port
connect to it .


I found out that the ssh works like this ssh<username>@<remote>
with remote being the server;
That of course could be done if you have SSH INSTALLED, which having
it not installed is rare but not impossible , so first find out how to
install and use it.

I logged in the level0 using the bandit0 username and the bandit0
password
