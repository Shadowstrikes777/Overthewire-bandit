ok so I just finished level0 and it asked me to go to level1 now
while staying into bandit0

it says the password is stored in a readme file. So we just have to
find what linux command to read a file .
ok so the cat commands does it, cat file
then it gives the password go ahead and copy it so that we can ssh to
the next level

if you still are not familiar with ssh it is as follow
ssh -p2220 bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
-p specifies the port

when prompted for the password give the password you have copied.
ok actually you need to exit the bandit0 before doing the ssh again,
use the "exit" command and redo the ssh command above.

reminder: if you are unsure about something google it.
I have successfully connected to bandit1 now we have to go from bandit1 to bandit2
NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL
the password for bandit2 is stored in a file called -
first list files using ls

we can try to cat the file again using cat
it doesn t work. we look at google about dashed file name and find out it is a special file type so then cat it the big boss way, I ll let you find that out yourself
again use google

for the ssh don t forget the format bandit(levelid)@hostname
