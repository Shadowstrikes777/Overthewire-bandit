oh so it says that it is in data.txt and a few human-readable strings
preceded by several = characters maybe I can try to look at the string
command manual or the grep manual maybe one of the things or commands need to solve that level
it seems that I am in a good way cause looking at the stirngs command
it s not bad BUT ihave to sleep

Hello guys, it s me again and today I ll try to finish this level.

Ok I used the strings command to show me all the content of the file since the file
is somehow encoded in binary or whatever that is , then I grep the = character and
took the random alphabet one cause most of the password are like that
