ok so I used the sort command to look up for the password idk if this is the right way 
I was wrong using sort -u -c did not give the password

Oh so I got back to the challenge today and what I did first
is that I looked at grep manual and I tried to find out if there was
a way to find only uniq password but I didn t succeed however I learned
more and better about patterns and regular expressions and such and such.
Since the manual reading skill is improving I looked at the uniq manual
and found out that -u shows only the uniq ones, after cat I could
pipe it into sort then do the uniq command and found out the password
